# N-Body-Python simulation
 N-Body simulations using Barnes-Hut algorithm tu simulate orbits in two dimentions, allowing the selection of near ratio performance in the calculations presenting the results of the simulation in a video format.
 

 ## Galaxy colitions
This algorithm was used to simulate galaxy colitions up to 4000 objects, rendered in an apple silicon M1 chip, we present snapshots of some of the simulations.
